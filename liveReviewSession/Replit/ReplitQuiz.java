/*
In the given program you have a quiz question and a scanner to get the user input which will be stored on string a.

after the user inputs an answer (a, b or c) we need to check if its the correct, wrong, or invalid answer.

HINT
We did not learn "equals" method from String. In order to do this task with if-else if-else statements you need to know equals method. However you can try to solve this with Switch statement easily.

what is the farthest planet in the solar system:
a)venus
b)pluto
c)neptune
